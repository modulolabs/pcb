To export data for manufacturing:

* Load and run Eagle/Modulo.cam from the eagle cam processor. This will generate files in <Board>/Modulo<Board>RFQ/
* Run the ulp moundsmd.ulp and save the mount files to the same RFQ directory
* Run Eagle/integer-bom.ulp to generate the bom file and save it to the same RFQ directory.
